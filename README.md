# All-of-My-Uni-s-Project
Hello

My name is Iman.
I aspire to be a full-stack developer.
I love to do some code and artwork and share it in the future.
Hence, I am studying multimedia computing because I like the code and design aspect to it.

Thank you for reading my quick introduction.

Also I want to mention, every uni's project I do is based on limited knowledge I have at a time.
I dont mind anyone want to correct me, I mind the attitude.
Please respect each other when giving advice.
